A hybrid chatbot built for mental health support using both semantic understanding (Sentence-BERT) and sentiment analysis.
It provides emotionally aware responses through a user-friendly web interface built with Flask.

## 🧠 About the Project

This project is a conversational AI chatbot designed to support users in dealing with mental health-related queries. It uses a combination of:

- **Semantic Matching** with a fine-tuned Sentence-BERT model
- **Sentiment Analysis** using VADER to detect user emotion
- **Flask Web App** for an interactive browser-based chat interface

The chatbot intelligently retrieves answers based on both **semantic relevance** and **user sentiment**, enhancing user interaction and emotional context.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Flask** – Web framework
- **NLTK** – Tokenization and Sentiment Analysis
- **SentenceTransformers (Sentence-BERT)** – Semantic embeddings
- **Scikit-learn** – Cosine similarity calculation
